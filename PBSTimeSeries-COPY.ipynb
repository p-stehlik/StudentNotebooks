    "SOMETHING\n",
    "This notebook provides a step by steb guide to doing data wrangling (cleaning, filtering etc) for your publicaly available PBS data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can amend this notebook for MBS or other data but you should feel comfortable that you understand the code and what it means, and make any adjustments accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: use co-pilot or Google AI to help you understand the code and how you might amend it to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do update the code, it is good practice to document your logic (i.e. what the code is doing and why) using comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are done by using # at the start of the code line - you can see lots of commenting I have put in below, hopefully this helps you understand what you are doing and why!\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, we want to clean whatever data you have so you can create a nice visual - so ultimately you need to consider what you want at the end and create a dataframe that can be easily analysed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this course, we will use a [pre-developed Shiny app](https://robin-visser.shinyapps.io/The_TIM/) that can do a few different kinds of time series analyses for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the example on the app to see what structure your final data needs to be in."
